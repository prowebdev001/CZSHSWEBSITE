            <h1>STEM</h1>
             <h3>(Science Technology Engineering Mathematics)</h3>
             <p>STEM is an educational approach that focuses on integrating these four disciplines to promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation. STEM education seeks to equip students with the knowledge and skills to tackle real-world challenges and prepare them for careers in fields such as engineering, computer science, healthcare, and environmental science, among others. The STEM approach involves hands-on learning experiences, project-based activities, and inquiry-based instruction that encourages students to explore and experiment with concepts and ideas. STEM education emphasizes the use of technology and other tools to collect and analyze data, design and build prototypes, and test and evaluate solutions to problems.</p>
